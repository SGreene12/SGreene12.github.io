Cyber Girls Program 


          In light of what we have seen recently in the media as it relates to the Russian hack along with many incidences of data breach, there is definitely a need to create a diverse workforce to tackle such attacks. Before the “technological explosion”, there were fewer incidences of identity theft and data breaches. And while doing business online has made life more convenient in many ways, it has in more ways than one put people's personal identifiable information at risk. Of course, I do agree that there are more advantages than disadvantages to using the internet, however, the disadvantages have left many devastated to say the least. 

With the world aggressively leaning towards technology, there is a growing need for security online and data protection of all kinds at every level. Hence, there is a need for more Cyber Security Professionals. It is said that” it’s a man’s world” and from common knowledge, it is known that there is a significant gap in the workforce between men and women as it concerns the STEM fields. Nevertheless, I do believe that women can make an equal and significant contribution in any field they choose to pursue. For no doubt, we bring a set of innate skills and abilities to the table that help to fulfill any desired end. Consequently, teaching in an all-girl school, I am passionate about exposing and encouraging our students to venture into uncharted territories, mainly the STEM fields. With the proper direction and/or guidance the students can rise to their greatest potential while living in a “man’s world”. It is for this reason, I am applying for this year’s Cyber Security program. 

The knowledge and skills I hope to acquire from this program will be used to teach the students the rudiments of Cyber Security and channel them in the path of becoming a Cyber Security Professional. This will be done by implementing an elective course with the curriculum covered in the program that will be open to students across every grade level.
