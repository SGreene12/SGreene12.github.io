<p> <strong>The Benefits of Spirituality on Health and Well-being</strong>

<br>
<br>

Spirituality, religion, and prayer can play an important role in wellness. That's not just the point of view of spiritual practitioners but rather the findings of a growing body of research.
Prayer may elicit the relaxation response, along with feelings of hope, gratitude, and compassion all of which have a positive effect on overall wellbeing. There are several types of prayer, many of which are rooted in the belief that there is a higher power that has some level of influence over your life. This belief can provide a sense of comfort and support in difficult times a recent study found that clinically depressed adults who believed their prayers were heard by a concerned presence responded much better to treatment than those who did not believe. </p>

<p3> <strong> Reading Fiction Improves Brain Connectivity and Function</strong>

<br>
<br>

Neuroscientists have discovered that reading a novel can improve brain function on a variety of levels. The recent study on the brain benefits of reading fiction was conducted at Emory University. The study titled, “Short- and Long-Term Effects of a Novel on Connectivity in the Brain," was recently published in the journal Brain Connectivity.The researchers found that becoming engrossed in a novel enhances connectivity in the brain and improves brain function. Interestingly, reading fiction was found to improve the reader's ability to put themselves in another person’s shoes and flex the imagination in a way that is similar to the visualization of a muscle memory in sports.
